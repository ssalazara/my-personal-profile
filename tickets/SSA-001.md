### BUG: Hero Banner Layout is Inconsistent for 'Image-Left' Variation

*   **Ticket ID:** SSA-001
*   **Reported by:** Simon Salazar
*   **Date:** [Current Date]
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Component:** `Hero.astro`
*   **Story Points:** **2**

### Description

As a content editor, when I configure the homepage's Hero section to place the image on the **left**, I want the layout to render correctly as a two-column, side-by-side display on desktop screens.

This is to ensure the user experience is visually consistent with the "Image-Right" variation, which currently works as expected.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   **AC1:** When `heroImagePosition` is set to 'left', the hero image must appear in the left column and the text in the right column on viewports wider than 768px.
-   **AC2:** When `heroImagePosition` is set to 'right', the hero image must appear in the right column and the text in the left column on viewports wider than 768px.
-   **AC3:** On viewports narrower than 768px, the hero content and image must stack vertically in their natural HTML order (text first, then image).
-   **AC4:** The fix must not negatively impact the layout of other components, specifically the site `Header`.

### Current Behavior (The Bug)

Currently, the "Image-Right" variation works correctly. However, the "Image-Left" variation fails to render as two columns. Instead, the text and image stack vertically.

Browser DevTools inspection confirms that the parent `.hero-container` element is still being styled with `display: grid`, even after multiple attempts to refactor the component's CSS to use `display: flex`. This indicates a deep caching or build tool issue where code changes are not being reflected on the front end.

### Investigation & Fixes Attempted

Several standard and advanced debugging steps have been performed without resolving the issue:

1.  **CSS Refactor (Grid):** Initially attempted to use CSS Grid's `grid-column` property to reorder elements. This did not work.
2.  **CSS Refactor (Flexbox):** The component was completely rewritten to use a pure Flexbox implementation with the `order: -1` property for reordering. This is the theoretically correct approach but failed to apply.
3.  **Hard Reset Protocol:** A full hard reset was performed, which included:
    *   Stopping the dev server.
    *   Clearing the Vite build cache (`rm -rf node_modules/.vite`).
    *   Replacing the entire `Hero.astro` file content to ensure code correctness.
    *   Restarting the server and hard-refreshing the browser (`Cmd+Shift+R`).

Despite these measures, the browser continues to render a stale version of the CSS with `display: grid`.

### Possible Solutions & Next Steps

The persistence of the bug suggests the issue is not in the code logic itself but in the development environment or build process. The next developer should investigate the following hypotheses:

1.  **Inspect Computed Styles:** The top priority is to use the browser's "Computed" styles tab to identify **which file or rule** is applying the `display: grid` style. This will tell us if it's an old style from the same component or a leak from another CSS file.
2.  **Astro/Vite Cache Integrity:** The standard cache clear may not have been sufficient. Investigate if Astro or Vite maintains a more persistent cache elsewhere that needs to be manually deleted.
3.  **Workspace Isolation:** Clone the project into a completely new, separate directory on the machine and run `npm install` and `npm run dev`. This will definitively rule out any local workspace corruption or deeply hidden cache files.
4.  **Astro Version Issue:** As a last resort, check for any known HMR (Hot Module Replacement) or caching bugs related to the specific version of Astro being used.

### Effort Estimation

**2 Story Points.**
*   *Rationale:* This is not a simple code change. The issue requires in-depth debugging of the build tool's behavior and caching mechanisms. The investigation will take time and a methodical approach, fitting the 2-3 hour timeframe.
